# Capacitor Cordova Android Plugins

This directory contains the minimal structure for the `capacitor-cordova-android-plugins` Gradle module. It is normally generated by running `npx cap sync android`.

## Purpose

This module is required by Capacitor to build Android apps, even when no Cordova plugins are installed. It provides a placeholder for Cordova plugin integration.

## Contents

- `build.gradle` - Android library configuration
- `cordova.variables.gradle` - Cordova plugin variables (empty when no Cordova plugins are used)
- `src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Minimal Android manifest
- `src/main/libs/` - Directory for potential native library files

## Regeneration

If you run `npx cap sync android`, this directory will be regenerated. The committed version is a minimal baseline to allow Gradle builds without requiring Capacitor sync first.

## Build Directory

The `build/` directory within this module is ignored by `.gitignore` as it contains build artifacts.
