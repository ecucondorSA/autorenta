# üîç WITHDRAWAL SYSTEM AUDIT REPORT

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Auditor**: Claude Code
**Status**: FINDINGS DOCUMENTED

---

## Executive Summary

An audit of the automated withdrawal system reveals a **critical discrepancy**:

**Finding**: One withdrawal (ID: `8962cf4a-19e8-4dcb-a704-cef18d7c3b42`) is marked as **"completed"** in the database, but the transaction metadata reveals it was a **simulated/test transaction**, NOT a real transfer to the user's bank account.

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå User's real money was NEVER sent to their bank account
- ‚úÖ System correctly processed the request
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue is in transaction confirmation logic, not in automation

---

## Detailed Findings

### Transaction Under Review

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Withdrawal ID** | `8962cf4a-19e8-4dcb-a704-cef18d7c3b42` |
| **Amount** | 1,000.00 ARS |
| **Commission** | 15.00 ARS (1.5%) |
| **Net Amount** | 985.00 ARS |
| **Status** | `completed` |
| **Recipient** | Juan P√©rez (CBU: 0170018740000000123456) |
| **Bank** | Banco Galicia |
| **Created** | 2025-10-18 08:12:21 UTC |
| **Completed** | 2025-10-18 08:14:33 UTC |
| **Processing Time** | 132 seconds (~2.2 minutes) |

### Wallet Transaction Record

```json
{
  "id": "490be73a-7f97-4fde-8dd7-c9860e2beb60",
  "type": "withdrawal",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": 1015.00,
  "provider": "mercadopago",
  "provider_transaction_id": "MP-TEST-967ecb81-8e38-4521-a50c-1a21deb087d9",
  "provider_metadata": {
    "test": true,
    "simulated": true
  },
  "completed_at": "2025-10-18 08:14:33.197063+00"
}
```

### Key Evidence

**Critical Metadata Field**: `"test": true, "simulated": true`

This metadata is embedded in the `provider_metadata` JSONB column, indicating:
- ‚ùå This was NOT a production transaction
- ‚ùå Money was NOT actually transferred
- ‚ö†Ô∏è System marked it as "completed" based on a simulated response

### User Wallet Status

```
User ID:           11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
Available Balance:  5,000.00 ARS (UNCHANGED!)
Locked Balance:    0.00 ARS
Currency:          ARS
```

**Analysis**: The balance shows **5,000 ARS remaining**. If a real withdrawal of 1,000 ARS + 15 ARS commission occurred, the balance should be:
- Expected: 3,985 ARS
- Actual: 5,000 ARS
- **Difference: 1,015 ARS (NOT withdrawn from wallet!)**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Layer 1: Database Triggers ‚úÖ
- Auto-approval: Working correctly
- Validation limits: Applied correctly
- Status transitions: Correct sequence

### Layer 2: Edge Function (quick-action) ‚ö†Ô∏è
The Edge Function received the withdrawal request and called MercadoPago API.

**Question**: Did the function receive a TEST response from MercadoPago?

### Layer 3: MercadoPago API Response ‚ùå
**Issue Identified**:
- The `provider_metadata` shows `"test": true, "simulated": true`
- This indicates MercadoPago returned a **simulated/test response**
- The system treated this as a successful completion

**Possible Causes**:
1. MercadoPago credentials are in **TEST mode** (not production)
2. The transfer endpoint is pointing to test API, not production API
3. The CBU/account being used is invalid for production transfers
4. MercadoPago environment variable is misconfigured

### Layer 4: Webhook Confirmation ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Question**: Did the withdrawal-webhook receive a notification that status was "test"?

If webhook is receiving test notifications and marking as "completed", this explains the discrepancy.

## Investigation Steps Completed

### ‚úÖ Database Audit
```sql
-- Verified withdrawal record exists
SELECT * FROM withdrawal_requests
WHERE id = '8962cf4a-19e8-4dcb-a704-cef18d7c3b42'
-- Result: status = 'completed', failure_reason = NULL

-- Verified wallet transaction exists
SELECT * FROM wallet_transactions
WHERE reference_id = '8962cf4a-19e8-4dcb-a704-cef18d7c3b42'
-- Result: metadata shows test: true, simulated: true

-- Verified wallet balance NOT deducted
SELECT available_balance FROM user_wallets
WHERE user_id = '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111'
-- Result: 5,000.00 ARS (unchanged after withdrawal)
```

### ‚úÖ Bank Account Verification
- Account Type: CBU
- Account Number: 0170018740000000123456
- Bank: Banco Galicia
- Holder: Juan P√©rez
- Verified: FALSE (is_verified = false)

---

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue #1: Test Transaction Marked as Completed ‚ùå
**Severity**: CRITICAL

**Problem**:
- Withdrawal status set to "completed"
- No actual money transferred to bank account
- Wallet balance unchanged (1,015 ARS not deducted)
- Metadata explicitly says "test": true, "simulated": true

**Impact**:
- User shows money was withdrawn when it wasn't
- Wallet balance is incorrect
- User could submit another withdrawal and exceed available funds
- Financial inconsistency in system

### Issue #2: Bank Account Not Verified ‚ùå
**Severity**: HIGH

**Problem**:
- `bank_accounts.is_verified = false`
- CBU provided is a test CBU (0170018740000000123456)
- No verification method recorded (verification_method = NULL)

**Impact**:
- MercadoPago will reject transfers to unverified accounts
- Tests cannot proceed without real account verification

### Issue #3: Environment Possibly Not Production ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Severity**: HIGH

**Indicators**:
- Transaction ID prefix: `MP-TEST-*` (not production ID)
- Metadata: `"test": true, "simulated": true`
- CBU: Test CBU (not real account)

## System Behavior Analysis

### What Happened (Timeline)

1. **08:12:21** - User requested withdrawal of 1,000 ARS
2. **08:12:21** - Database trigger auto-approved (< 1ms)
3. **08:12:21** - Edge Function called
4. **08:12:21-08:14:33** - Edge Function processed (132 seconds)
5. **08:14:33** - MercadoPago returned response
6. **08:14:33** - System marked as "completed"
7. **PROBLEM**: Response was TEST/SIMULATED, not real transfer

### System Assumptions (INCORRECT)

The system assumed:
- ‚úÖ If MercadoPago returns success ‚Üí money was transferred
- ‚ùå **Did NOT verify**: Transaction ID format (MP-TEST-* = test)
- ‚ùå **Did NOT verify**: Metadata fields (test: true = test transaction)
- ‚ùå **Did NOT verify**: Actual funds left user's wallet

---

## Wallet Balance Inconsistency

### Expected State
```
After withdrawal of 1,000 ARS + 15 ARS fee:
- Available Balance: 5,000 - 1,015 = 3,985 ARS
- Locked Balance: 0 ARS
```

### Actual State
```
After "completed" withdrawal:
- Available Balance: 5,000 ARS (UNCHANGED!)
- Locked Balance: 0 ARS
```

### Analysis
The **withdrawal_requests** table shows status = "completed", but **user_wallets** table was NEVER updated with the deduction. This indicates:

1. The webhook completion handler did NOT call the wallet deduction function
2. OR: The wallet deduction was skipped due to test/simulated detection
3. OR: There's no wallet integration in the withdrawal system

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (DO NOW)

1. **Verify MercadoPago Environment**
   ```bash
   # Check if we're using TEST or PRODUCTION credentials
   # Production should have: APP_USR-563... (actual credentials)
   # Production transaction IDs should be: PM-... or longer UUID, NOT MP-TEST-*
   ```

2. **Check Edge Function Code**
   - Look at `/supabase/functions/mercadopago-money-out/index.ts`
   - Verify it's calling PRODUCTION MercadoPago endpoint
   - Check if it's parsing test metadata correctly

3. **Verify Webhook Configuration**
   - MercadoPago Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Ensure webhook is NOT in test mode
   - Verify it's receiving production notifications

4. **Reset Test Transaction**
   ```sql
   -- Mark as failed (since it was actually a test)
   UPDATE withdrawal_requests
   SET status = 'failed',
       failure_reason = 'Test transaction - money not actually transferred'
   WHERE id = '8962cf4a-19e8-4dcb-a704-cef18d7c3b42';

   -- Note: Do NOT do this without understanding full impact
   ```

### System Improvements Needed

1. **Add Transaction Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Before marking completed, validate:
   - Transaction ID should NOT start with "MP-TEST-"
   - Metadata should NOT have test: true or simulated: true
   - Provider response should indicate production transfer
   ```

2. **Add Wallet Deduction Verification**
   ```sql
   -- When withdrawal completed, verify:
   SELECT available_balance FROM user_wallets
   WHERE user_id = withdrawal_requests.user_id;

   -- Amount should be deducted before marking as "completed"
   -- If not deducted, rollback or alert
   ```

3. **Implement Audit Trail**
   ```sql
   -- Log all status changes:
   - pending ‚Üí approved
   - approved ‚Üí processed
   - processed ‚Üí completed/failed
   - Include who changed it, when, why
   ```

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Environment Detection**
   - Add startup check: "Is this PRODUCTION or TEST?"
   - Different handling based on environment
   - Clear logging of which environment is running

2. **Transaction Verification Checklist**
   - Validate provider_transaction_id format
   - Validate metadata doesn't indicate test mode
   - Check account verification status before marking complete
   - Require wallet deduction confirmation

3. **Reconciliation Process**
   - Daily/weekly: Compare withdrawal_requests.completed with actual MercadoPago transfers
   - Alert on discrepancies (completed but not actually transferred)
   - Manual intervention process

4. **User Communication**
   - If withdrawal shows "completed" but money hasn't arrived after 24h ‚Üí auto-alert user
   - Provide MercadoPago reference ID for tracing
   - Clear explanation of processing timeline

## Files Affected / To Review

1. **Database Tables** (VERIFIED ‚úÖ)
   - `withdrawal_requests` - Status tracking
   - `wallet_transactions` - Transaction ledger
   - `user_wallets` - Balance tracking
   - `bank_accounts` - Recipient info

2. **Edge Function** (NEEDS REVIEW ‚ö†Ô∏è)

   - Check if calling test or production API

3. **Webhook Handler** (NEEDS REVIEW ‚ö†Ô∏è)
   - `/supabase/functions/withdrawal-webhook/index.ts`
   - Verify it's not treating test responses as real

4. **Environment Configuration** (NEEDS REVIEW ‚ö†Ô∏è)
   - `.env` / Supabase Vault
   - `MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Is this test or production?

- wallet_transactions table: 1 transaction (the problematic one)
- user_wallets table: Balance unchanged
- bank_accounts table: Test accounts

### Transaction Metadata
```json
{
  "id": "490be73a-7f97-4fde-8dd7-c9860e2beb60",
  "type": "withdrawal",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": 1015.00,
  "provider": "mercadopago",
  "provider_transaction_id": "MP-TEST-967ecb81-8e38-4521-a50c-1a21deb087d9",
  "provider_metadata": {
    "test": true,
    "simulated": true
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

### Summary
The automated withdrawal system is **functionally working correctly** from a code perspective:
- ‚úÖ Database triggers fire
- ‚úÖ Auto-approval works
- ‚úÖ Edge Functions execute
- ‚úÖ Webhooks receive responses

**However**: The system is **accepting test/simulated responses as real transfers** and marking them as "completed" without:
1. Deducting from user wallet balance
2. Verifying it's a real transfer (not simulated)
3. Checking if account is verified
4. Validating transaction metadata

### Root Cause
The system likely received a **test response from MercadoPago** (possibly due to using test environment or test credentials) and treated it as a successful production transfer.

### Next Steps
1. Verify MercadoPago credentials are for PRODUCTION, not TEST
2. Verify Edge Function is calling production API endpoints
3. Add validation to reject test/simulated responses
4. Verify account verification status before marking complete
5. Implement wallet balance deduction confirmation
