## 🔍 Verification Queries

### Check Bookings
```sql
SELECT id, renter_id, start_at, end_at, total_amount, status 
FROM bookings 
WHERE created_at > now() - interval '1 day'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Risk Snapshots
```sql
SELECT brs.id, brs.booking_id, b.id as booking_exists
FROM booking_risk_snapshot brs
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON b.id = brs.booking_id
WHERE brs.created_at > now() - interval '1 day';
```

All `booking_exists` should be NOT NULL ✅

## 🚨 If Something Breaks

### Rollback
```bash
# 1. Revert code
git checkout HEAD -- apps/web/src/app/features/bookings/
git checkout HEAD -- apps/web/src/app/core/services/risk.service.ts

# 2. Rollback migration
