# üíº ADMIN WITHDRAWAL DASHBOARD - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: HIGH - Enables manual withdrawal processing workflow

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive admin dashboard for managing withdrawal requests from locadores (car owners). This is the **manual processing solution** for the wallet system, as MercadoPago has no public Money Out API available.

**Key Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ Full withdrawal management UI with filters and search
- ‚úÖ Batch export to CSV for bank processing
- ‚úÖ Approve/Reject/Complete workflow
- ‚úÖ Detailed withdrawal request modal
- ‚úÖ Real-time status tracking
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing wallet system

---

## üéØ Business Context

**Why Manual Processing?**

After extensive investigation (documented in `MERCADOPAGO_WITHDRAWAL_API_FINDINGS.md`), we confirmed that:
- ‚ùå MercadoPago has NO public Money Out API
- ‚ùå Split Payments are NOT suitable for this business model
- ‚úÖ Wallet system IS necessary to mediate payments between owners and renters
- ‚úÖ Manual withdrawal processing is the ONLY viable solution

**User's Explicit Requirement** (from conversation):
> "eliminar la wallet no es una buena idea, porque necesitamos para mediar los pagos entre locadores y locatarios, tambien, es necesario que los clientes sin tarjeta de credito deposite en la wallet"

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Layer (/home/edu/autorenta/database/create-withdrawal-system.sql)

**Tables:**
- `bank_accounts`: User bank account information (CBU/CVU/Alias)
- `withdrawal_requests`: Withdrawal request lifecycle tracking

**RPC Functions:**
- `wallet_request_withdrawal()`: Creates withdrawal request (called by users)
- `wallet_approve_withdrawal()`: Approves request (admin only)
- `wallet_complete_withdrawal()`: Completes transfer, debits wallet
- `wallet_fail_withdrawal()`: Marks as failed

**Status Flow:**
```
pending ‚Üí approved ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed
   ‚Üì          ‚Üì
rejected   failed
```

### Service Layer (/home/edu/autorenta/apps/web/src/app/core/services/admin.service.ts)

**New Methods:**
```typescript
async listWithdrawalRequests(status?: string): Promise<WithdrawalRequest[]>
async approveWithdrawal(requestId: string, adminNotes?: string): Promise<void>
async completeWithdrawal(requestId: string, transactionId: string, metadata?: any): Promise<void>
async rejectWithdrawal(requestId: string, reason: string): Promise<void>
async failWithdrawal(requestId: string, reason: string): Promise<void>
```

**Query Features:**
- Joins with `profiles` for user name
- Joins with `auth.users` for email
- Joins with `bank_accounts` for transfer details
- Filters by status (pending, approved, completed, etc.)
- Sorted by created_at DESC

### Models Layer (/home/edu/autorenta/apps/web/src/app/core/models/index.ts)

**New TypeScript Interfaces:**
```typescript
export type AccountType = 'cbu' | 'cvu' | 'alias';
export type WithdrawalStatus = 'pending' | 'approved' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'rejected' | 'cancelled';

export interface BankAccount { ... }
export interface WithdrawalRequest { ... }
export interface WalletTransaction { ... }
export interface UserWallet { ... }
```

### Component Layer (/home/edu/autorenta/apps/web/src/app/features/admin/withdrawals/)

**Files Created:**
- `admin-withdrawals.page.ts`: Main component logic (280+ lines)
- `admin-withdrawals.page.html`: Template with table, filters, modal (350+ lines)
- `admin-withdrawals.page.css`: Styles

**Features:**
- Stats cards (pending count, total amount, total requests)
- Status filters (All, Pending, Approved, Completed)
- Export to CSV functionality
- Detailed withdrawal modal with actions
- Real-time data refresh
- Color-coded status badges

## üîÑ Admin Workflow

### Scenario: Locador Requests Withdrawal

**Step 1: User Creates Request**
- User goes to Wallet page
- Clicks "Solicitar Retiro"
- Enters amount (e.g., $1,000 ARS)
- Selects bank account (CBU/CVU/Alias)
- Optionally adds notes
- System creates `withdrawal_request` with status `pending`

**Step 2: Admin Reviews Request**
- Admin navigates to `/admin/withdrawals`
- Sees new request in "Pendientes" filter
- Clicks "Ver detalles"
- Reviews user info, bank account, amount
- Adds admin notes (optional)

**Step 3: Admin Approves**
- Clicks "Aprobar" button
- System calls `wallet_approve_withdrawal()`
- Status changes to `approved`

**Step 4: Admin Processes Transfer**
- Admin performs manual bank transfer via:
  - Online banking portal
  - Batch file upload
  - MercadoPago manual transfer
- After successful transfer, admin clicks "Marcar como Completado"
- Enters transaction ID (e.g., bank reference number)
- System calls `wallet_complete_withdrawal()`
- System debits wallet: `amount + fee_amount`
- Status changes to `completed`

**Step 5: User Notified** (Future Enhancement)
- User sees updated wallet balance
- User receives email notification
- Transaction appears in wallet history

### Scenario: Rejection

**When to Reject:**
- Insufficient funds (shouldn't happen, validated at request time)
- Suspicious activity
- Incorrect bank account details
- User requested cancellation

**Process:**
1. Admin enters rejection reason in notes
2. Clicks "Rechazar"
3. System calls `rejectWithdrawal()`
4. Status changes to `rejected`
5. Funds remain in user's wallet

### Scenario: Failure

**When to Mark as Failed:**
- Bank transfer was rejected
- Bank account is closed
- Technical issue with transfer

**Process:**
1. Admin clicks "Marcar como Fallido" (future button)
2. Enters failure reason
3. System calls `wallet_fail_withdrawal()`
4. Status changes to `failed`
5. Funds remain in user's wallet

---

## üîí Security & Validation

**RLS Policies** (in create-withdrawal-system.sql):
- ‚úÖ Users can only view/create their own withdrawal requests
- ‚úÖ Admins can view/modify ALL withdrawal requests
- ‚úÖ Admin check: `profiles.is_admin = TRUE`

**Validation** (in wallet_request_withdrawal RPC):
- ‚úÖ Minimum withdrawal: $100 ARS
- ‚úÖ Bank account must belong to user
- ‚úÖ Bank account must be active
- ‚úÖ Sufficient balance check: `available_balance >= (amount + fee)`
- ‚úÖ Fee calculation: 1.5% of amount

**Authorization** (in AdminService):
- ‚úÖ All methods protected by AuthGuard
- ‚úÖ RPC functions check `auth.uid()`
- ‚úÖ Admin-only functions verify `is_admin` flag

---

## üí∞ Fee Structure

**Current Configuration:**
- **Fee Rate**: 1.5% of withdrawal amount
- **Minimum Amount**: $100 ARS
- **Fee Formula**: `fee = ROUND(amount * 0.015, 2)`

**Example:**
- User requests: $1,000 ARS
- Platform fee: $15 ARS (1.5%)
- User receives: $985 ARS
- **Wallet debit**: $1,015 ARS (amount + fee)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Tiered fee structure (larger amounts = lower %)
- Fixed minimum fee ($15 ARS)
- Free withdrawals above certain threshold

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Email Query Complexity**
   - Current solution uses nested join: `profiles ‚Üí auth.users`
   - May fail if profile doesn't exist for user
   - **Mitigation**: Show "N/A" for missing email

2. **No Real-Time Updates**
   - Admin must manually refresh page to see new requests
   - **Future**: Add Supabase Realtime subscriptions

3. **No Bulk Actions**
   - Admin must approve each withdrawal individually
   - **Future**: Add checkboxes for batch operations

4. **CSV Export Limitations**
   - Exports ALL visible data (no pagination)
   - May be slow for 10,000+ withdrawals
   - **Future**: Add server-side CSV generation

---

## üí° Admin Best Practices

### Daily Routine:
1. **Morning**: Check pending withdrawals
2. **Review**: Verify bank account details are valid
3. **Approve**: Approve all valid requests
4. **Export**: Download CSV with approved requests
5. **Process**: Execute bank transfers via online banking
6. **Complete**: Mark all successful transfers as completed
7. **Evening**: Review any failed transfers, contact users if needed

### Red Flags to Watch:
- üö© Withdrawal amount = entire wallet balance (exit scam?)
- üö© Multiple withdrawals from same user in 24h
- üö© Bank account holder name ‚â† profile name
- üö© Newly registered user with large withdrawal
- üö© User with negative reviews requesting withdrawal

### Approval Guidelines:
- ‚úÖ User verified (KYC completed)
- ‚úÖ Bank account matches profile name
- ‚úÖ No recent disputes or chargebacks
- ‚úÖ No suspicious activity in wallet history
